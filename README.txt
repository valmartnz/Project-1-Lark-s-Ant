Introduction
    This program uses HTMl, Javascript (JS), and P5.js to create  
    an invisible bot that draws a grid. As it moves across the grid
    each cell will change color and depending on the color of the 
    cell, the bot will move in a specific direction. If it reaches
    the edge of the canvas, the bot will wrap around it and continue 
    to move from cell to cell.
